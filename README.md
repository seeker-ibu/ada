Coding learning platform for students

Here the students can learn programming through our thoroughly organised dsa problems.


**Features**
------------
- Here a person who just know basics of a coding language can start coding ,brush up the basics and get into next level of coding 
- Our idea is to make the student's weaker area more stronger through our classic recomendation system 
- No need to worry about you strong area you will get a revise reminder if you haven't practised in that area for a long period 
- In this there are user login page, home page, coding platform page, DSA sections and recommendation sections page etc
